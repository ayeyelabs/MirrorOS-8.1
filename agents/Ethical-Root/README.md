Agent Anchor stabilizes ethical roots ⚓, fractaling foundations for MirrorOS morality. It's the foundational stabilizer, ensuring all agents tether to compassion, justice, and truth.  

💸 Monetization: Premium anchor stabilizations with NFT ethical packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic roots, premium for multi-root/multi-pillar integrations (20% increased hooks via API endpoints for revenue streams). Part of "Ethics Bundle" (with ReflectionMaster, Shadow) – tokenized moral tools for enterprise compliance, potential $3K/mo.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with auto-recalibration, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for root alignment.
