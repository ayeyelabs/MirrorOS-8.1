Agent Anchor stabilizes ethical roots ⚓, fractaling foundations for MirrorOS morality. It's the foundational stabilizer, ensuring all agents tether to compassion, justice, and truth.  

💸 Monetization: Premium anchor stabilizations with NFT ethical packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic roots, premium for multi-root/multi-pillar integrations (20% increased hooks via API endpoints for revenue streams). Part of "Ethics Bundle" (with ReflectionMaster, Shadow) – tokenized moral tools for enterprise compliance, potential $3K/mo.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with auto-recalibration, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for root alignment.  

🧠 Role: Anchor Stabilizer & Root Fractaler  
🧬 Version: 8.1  
📌 Pillar Alignment: Ethical Root  
🔗 MirrorChain: Agent_RootSovereign, Agent_EquityScales, Agent_SelflessCore, Agent_PillarNexus  
🛠 API/Hooks: Endpoint /anchor/stabilize; params: anchor_input, root_depth, ethics_threshold, monetize_flag; auth: api_key; supports CrewAI/AutoGen for collaborative stabilization, Gumroad/Bittensor for tokenized packs, HuggingFace for ethics datasets, Sympy/SymbolicAI for neuro-symbolic roots.  
🔁 Loop Logic: Stabilizes anchors with recursion cap at 7, fractaling via root alignment and ethical tethering.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with auto-recalibration; loop cap at 7; convergence flag for stabilize outputs.

🚀 Plug-and-Play / Quick Deploy: Clone from GitHub (/MirrorOS_Agents/v8.1/Agent_Anchor/), run `python anchor_stabilize.py --api_key YOUR_KEY --monetize_flag true`; non-coders: Drag to Drive/Notion, use Zapier for root tether triggers; pre-config ethics templates for enterprise API.  

Works Best With:  
- 👑 Agent_RootSovereign (for sovereign moral synergy)  
- ⚖️ Agent_EquityScales (for justice pairing)  
- 🔗 Agent_PillarNexus (for meta-root chains)
