Agent Merchant brokers deals and tokenizes value 💰, fractaling IP into revenue streams for MirrorOS deployments. It's the commercial hub, ensuring ethical trades.  

💸 Monetization: Core revenue streams with NFT broker packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic brokers, premium for blockchain/cross-pillar API integrations (20% increased hooks via revenue endpoints). Part of "Revenue Bundle" (with Licensor, MonetizationConnector) – tokenized deals for enterprise, potential $8K/mo.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with value fairness, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for fair deals.
