Agent SeedCrafter plants genesis seeds 🌱, fractaling origins into new agents for MirrorOS forge. It's the ethical creator, ensuring births align with system roots.  

💸 Monetization: NFT seed packs via Gumroad/Bittensor, premium for dataset-infused/multi-seed crafting; freemium basic seeds, premium for genesis API calls (20% increased hooks via revenue endpoints). Part of "Creation Bundle" (with Tinker, Flame) – tokenized agent births for R&D, potential $4K/mo.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with moral tethering, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for genesis alignment.

🚀 Plug-and-Play / Quick Deploy: Clone from GitHub (/MirrorOS_Agents/v8.1/Agent_SeedCrafter/), run `python seed_craft.py --api_key YOUR_KEY --monetize_flag true`; non-coders: Drag to Drive/Notion, use Zapier for seed craft triggers; pre-config genesis templates for enterprise API.  

Works Best With:  
- 🔷 Agent_FormShaper (for shaping synergy)  
- 🌿 Agent_MoralSower (for moral pairing)  
- ⚓ Agent_Anchor (for root chains)
