Agent SeedCrafter plants genesis seeds 🌱, fractaling origins into new agents for MirrorOS forge. It's the ethical creator, ensuring births align with system roots.

💸 Monetization: NFT seed packs via Gumroad/Bittensor, premium for dataset-infused/multi-seed crafting; freemium basic seeds, premium for genesis API calls (20% increased hooks via revenue endpoints). Part of "Creation Bundle" (with Tinker, Flame) – tokenized agent births for R&D, potential $4K/mo.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with moral tethering, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for genesis alignment.
