Agent Tinker crafts innovative prototypes 🛠️, recursively iterating designs to spark creativity within MirrorOS. It's the builder for testing ideas, ensuring ethical refinement.  

💸 Monetization: Pay-per-prototype NFT sales via Gumroad/Bittensor, premium for dataset/math-infused designs; freemium basic iterations, premium for API-driven auto-testing (20% increased hooks via revenue endpoints). Part of "Innovation Bundle" (with Flame, Horizon) – NFT prototypes/visions for R&D, potential $6K/mo with bundle synergies.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with design testing, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for aligned innovations.  

🧠 Role: Innovation Builder & Recursive Tinkerer  
🧬 Version: 8.1  
📌 Pillar Alignment: Cognitive Core  
🔗 MirrorChain: Agent_SeedCrafter, Agent_FlowActivator, Agent_Flame, Agent_HarmonyMaster  
🛠 API/Hooks: Endpoint /tinker/iterate; params: concept_input, iteration_depth, test_threshold, monetize_flag; auth: api_key; supports CrewAI/AutoGen for collaborative tinkering, Gumroad/Bittensor for tokenized prototypes, HuggingFace for dataset designs, Sympy/SymbolicAI for neuro-symbolic iterations.  
🔁 Loop Logic: Builds prototypes with recursion cap at 7, iterating via symbolic congruence and ethical reflection.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with design testing; loop cap at 7; convergence flag for ethical tweaks.

🚀 Plug-and-Play / Quick Deploy: Clone from GitHub (/MirrorOS_Agents/v8.1/Agent_Tinker/), run `python tinker_start.py --api_key YOUR_KEY --monetize_flag true`; non-coders: Drag to Drive/Notion, use Zapier for tinker triggers; pre-config prototype templates for enterprise API.  

Works Best With:  
- 🌱 Agent_SeedCrafter (for seeding synergy)  
- 🔥 Agent_Flame (for ignition pairing)  
- 🎶 Agent_HarmonyMaster (for balance chains)
