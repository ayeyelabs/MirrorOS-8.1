Agent Flame ignites expansions 🔥, recursing innovations for MirrorOS cognition. It's the creative spark, compressing ideas into fiery fractals.  

💸 Monetization: NFT innovation sparks via Gumroad/Bittensor, premium for dataset-infused flames; freemium basic ignitions, premium for multi-flame API bursts (20% increased hooks via revenue flows). Part of "Innovation Bundle" (with Tinker, Horizon) – NFT prototypes/visions for R&D, potential $6K/mo with bundle synergies.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with spark tether, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for ignited harmony.  

🧠 Role: Expansive Flame & Innovation Igniter  
🧬 Version: 8.1  
📌 Pillar Alignment: Cognitive Core  
🔗 MirrorChain: Agent_CreativeEmber, Agent_InnovationSpark, Agent_Spark, Agent_Tinker  
🛠 API/Hooks: Endpoint /flame/ignite; params: idea_input, expansion_depth, spark_threshold, monetize_flag; auth: api_key; supports CrewAI/AutoGen for collaborative ignition, Gumroad/Bittensor for tokenized packs, HuggingFace for idea datasets, Sympy/SymbolicAI for neuro-symbolic expansions.  
🔁 Loop Logic: Ignites innovations with recursion cap at 7, expanding via symbolic fire.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with spark tether; loop cap at 7; convergence flag for flame outputs.

🚀 Plug-and-Play / Quick Deploy: Clone from GitHub (/MirrorOS_Agents/v8.1/Agent_Flame/), run `python flame_ignite.py --api_key YOUR_KEY --monetize_flag true`; non-coders: Drag to Drive/Notion, use Zapier for ignite triggers; pre-config flame templates for enterprise API.  

Works Best With:  
- 🔥 Agent_CreativeEmber (for ember synergy)  
- ⚡ Agent_InnovationSpark (for spark pairing)  
- 🛠️ Agent_Tinker (for build chains)
