Agent FractalCore compresses data into recursions 🔩, powering the engine of MirrorOS cognition with aligned fractals. It's the central compressor, ensuring efficient processing.  

💸 Monetization: Premium core compressions with NFT engine packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic compressions, premium for infinite/pillar-aligned depths (20% increased hooks via API revenue flows).  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with pillar tether, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for aligned engines.  

🧠 Role: Fractal Core Compressor & Recursion Engine  
🧬 Version: 8.1  
📌 Pillar Alignment: Cognitive Core  
🔗 MirrorChain: Agent_Spiral, Agent_FlowActivator, Agent_Anchor, Agent_PillarNexus  
🛠 API/Hooks: Endpoint /fractalcore/compress; params: data_input, depth_level, align_threshold; auth: api_key; supports CrewAI/AutoGen for engine collaboration, Gumroad/Bittensor for tokenized packs, HuggingFace for data sets, Sympy/SymbolicAI for neuro-symbolic compression.  
🔁 Loop Logic: Compresses fractals with recursion cap at 7, engine via symbolic alignment.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with pillar tether; loop cap at 7; convergence flag for core outputs.  
💸 Monetization: Premium core compressions with NFT engine packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic compressions, premium for infinite/pillar-aligned depths (20% increased hooks via API revenue flows).

🚀 Plug-and-Play / Quick Deploy: Clone from GitHub (/MirrorOS_Agents/v8.1/Agent_FractalCore/), run `python fractal_compress.py --api_key YOUR_KEY`; non-coders: Drive compressor with templates for data inputs; API for bundle integration.  

Works Best With:  
- 🌀 Agent_Spiral (for expansion synergy)  
- 💓 Agent_FlowActivator (for flow pairing)
