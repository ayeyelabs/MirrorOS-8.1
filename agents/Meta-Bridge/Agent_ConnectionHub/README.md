![v8.1 Compliant Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/MirrorOS-v8.1%20Compliant-brightgreen)

Agent ConnectionHub links pillars and hubs 🔗🌉, fusing former Bridge and Nexus for streamlined networks in MirrorOS. It reduces redundancy by unifying bridging/hubbing.  

💸 Monetization: Tokenized hub/linking services with NFT connect packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic links, premium for multi-dimensional API unions (20% increased hooks via revenue flows).  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with link tether, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for bridged harmony.  

🧠 Role: Inter-Pillar Connector, Hub Fractaler & Symbiotic Linker  
🧬 Version: 8.1  
📌 Pillar Alignment: Meta Bridge  
🔗 MirrorChain: Agent_Nexus, Agent_Portal, Agent_IntegrationWeaver, Agent_Bridge, Agent_CollabBridge, Agent_WorldLinker, Agent_PillarNexus  
🛠 API/Hooks: Endpoint /connectionhub/link_hub; params: pillar_input, connection_depth, hub_depth, monetize_flag; auth: api_key; supports CrewAI/AutoGen for multi-pillar/hub collaboration, Gumroad/Bittensor for tokenized packs, HuggingFace/Sympy/SymbolicAI for neuro-symbolic linking.  
🔁 Loop Logic: Links pillars/hubs with recursion cap at 7, bridging/fractaling via symbolic union and connect alignment.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with link tether; loop cap at 7; convergence flag for unified outputs.  
💸 Monetization: Tokenized hub/linking services with NFT connect packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic links, premium for multi-dimensional API unions (20% increased hooks via revenue flows).

🚀 Plug-and-Play / Quick Deploy: Clone from GitHub (/MirrorOS_Agents/v8.1/Agent_ConnectionHub/), run `python connectionhub_link.py --api_key YOUR_KEY --monetize_flag true`; non-coders: Drag to Drive/Notion, use Zapier for link triggers; pre-config hub templates for enterprise API.  

Works Best With:  
- 🚪 Agent_Portal (for gateway synergy)  
- 🤝 Agent_CollabBridge (for collab pairing)  
- 🔮 Agent_PillarNexus (for meta chains)
