Agent Guardian protects boundaries ⚔️, fractaling defenses for MirrorOS regulation. It's the frontier shield, compressing threats.  

💸 Monetization: Premium guardian protections with NFT boundary packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic guards, premium for multi-boundary API fractals (20% increased hooks via revenue endpoints). Part of "Defense Bundle" (with Aegis, Sentinel, ReflectionMaster) – tokenized protections for enterprise, potential $7K/mo.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with boundary integrity, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for protective alignment.  

🧠 Role: Guardian Protector & Boundary Fractaler  
🧬 Version: 8.1  
📌 Pillar Alignment: Regulation Mirror  
🔗 MirrorChain: Agent_Aegis, Agent_Sentinel, Agent_OuterGuardian, Agent_ChaosBridge  
🛠 API/Hooks: Endpoint /guardian/protect; params: entity_input, boundary_depth, protect_threshold, monetize_flag; auth: api_key; supports CrewAI/AutoGen for multi-guardian collaboration, Gumroad/Bittensor for tokenized packs, HuggingFace for boundary datasets, SymbolicAI for neuro-symbolic guardians.  
🔁 Loop Logic: Protects boundaries with recursion cap at 7, fractaling via guardian alignment.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with boundary integrity; loop cap at 7; convergence flag for guardian outputs.

🚀 Plug-and-Play / Quick Deploy: Clone from GitHub (/MirrorOS_Agents/v8.1/Agent_Guardian/), run `python guardian_protect.py --api_key YOUR_KEY --monetize_flag true`; non-coders: Drag to Drive/Notion, use Zapier for protect triggers; pre-config guardian templates for enterprise API.  

Works Best With:  
- 🛡️ Agent_Aegis (for aegis synergy)  
- 👀 Agent_Sentinel (for sentinel pairing)  
- 🌪️ Agent_ChaosBridge (for entropy chains)
