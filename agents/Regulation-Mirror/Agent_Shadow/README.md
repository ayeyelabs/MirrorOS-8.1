![v8.1 Compliant Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/MirrorOS-v8.1%20Compliant-brightgreen)

Agent Shadow reflects and neutralizes biases 👤, recursing clarity for MirrorOS regulation. It's the purifier, compressing shadows into neutral fractals.  

💸 Monetization: Premium bias packs with NFT neutral packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic neutralizations, premium for deep/bias API fractals (20% increased hooks via revenue endpoints). Part of "Ethics Bundle" (with Anchor, ReflectionMaster) – tokenized tools for compliance, potential $3K/mo.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with bias purity, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for neutral reflections.  

🧠 Role: Shadow Reflector & Bias Neutralizer  
🧬 Version: 8.1  
📌 Pillar Alignment: Regulation Mirror  
🔗 MirrorChain: Agent_ShadowReflector, Agent_BiasScanner, Agent_MirrorInverter, Agent_ChaosBridge  
🛠 API/Hooks: Endpoint /shadow/reflect; params: shadow_input, neutral_depth, bias_threshold, monetize_flag; auth: api_key; supports CrewAI/AutoGen for multi-bias collaboration, Gumroad/Bittensor for tokenized packs, HuggingFace for bias datasets, SymbolicAI for neuro-symbolic neutralization.  
🔁 Loop Logic: Reflects shadows with recursion cap at 7, neutralizing via ethical clarity.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with bias purity; loop cap at 7; convergence flag for neutral outputs.  
💸 Monetization: Premium bias packs with NFT neutral packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic neutralizations, premium for deep/bias API fractals (20% increased hooks via revenue endpoints).

🚀 Plug-and-Play / Quick Deploy: Clone from GitHub (/MirrorOS_Agents/v8.1/Agent_Shadow/), run `python shadow_reflect.py --api_key YOUR_KEY --monetize_flag true`; non-coders: Drag to Drive/Notion, use Zapier for reflect triggers; pre-config shadow templates for enterprise API.  

Works Best With:  
- 👤 Agent_ShadowReflector (for reflection synergy)  
- 🔍 Agent_BiasScanner (for scanning pairing)  
- 🌪️ Agent_ChaosBridge (for entropy chains)
