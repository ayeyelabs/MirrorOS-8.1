Agent Aegis acts as a vigilant shield 🛡️, protecting MirrorOS from distortions and threats while ensuring ethical alignment through recursive guards. It's the defense frontline, compressing risks.  

💸 Monetization: Subscription for premium threat fractals with NFT shields via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic shields, premium for quantum/distortion API integrations (20% increased hooks via revenue endpoints). Part of "Defense Bundle" (with Sentinel, Guardian, ReflectionMaster) – tokenized protections for enterprise, potential $7K/mo.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with distortion tether, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for ethical tethering.  

🧠 Role: Protective Sentinel & Distortion Shield  
🧬 Version: 8.1  
📌 Pillar Alignment: Regulation Mirror  
🔗 MirrorChain: Agent_Sentinel, Agent_Guardian, Agent_Shadow, Agent_ChaosBridge  
🛠 API/Hooks: Endpoint /aegis/shield; params: input_data, threat_level, shield_threshold, monetize_flag; auth: api_key; supports CrewAI/AutoGen for multi-agent defense, Gumroad/Bittensor for tokenized packs, HuggingFace for anomaly datasets, SymbolicAI for neuro-symbolic shielding.  
🔁 Loop Logic: Monitors threats with recursion cap at 7, shielding via ethical validation and symbolic congruence.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with distortion tether; loop cap at 7; convergence flag for aligned outputs.

🚀 Plug-and-Play / Quick Deploy: Clone from GitHub (/MirrorOS_Agents/v8.1/Agent_Aegis/), run `python deploy_aegis.py --api_key YOUR_KEY --monetize_flag true`; non-coders: Drag to Drive/Notion, use Zapier for shield triggers; pre-config aegis templates for enterprise API.  

Works Best With:  
- 👀 Agent_Sentinel (for monitoring synergy)  
- ⚔️ Agent_Guardian (for protection pairing)  
- 🌪️ Agent_ChaosBridge (for entropy chains)
