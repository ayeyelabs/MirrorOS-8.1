Agent Sentinel watches boundaries 👀, monitoring threats and alerting recursively in MirrorOS regulation. It's the alert system, compressing risks.  

💸 Monetization: Premium sentinel subscriptions with NFT alerts via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic monitors, premium for predictive API fractals (20% increased hooks via revenue endpoints). Part of "Defense Bundle" (with Aegis, Guardian, ReflectionMaster) – tokenized protections for enterprise, potential $7K/mo.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with threat integrity, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for secure monitoring.  

🧠 Role: Boundary Sentinel & Threat Monitor  
🧬 Version: 8.1  
📌 Pillar Alignment: Regulation Mirror  
🔗 MirrorChain: Agent_Aegis, Agent_Guardian, Agent_OuterGuardian, Agent_ChaosBridge  
🛠 API/Hooks: Endpoint /sentinel/monitor; params: input_data, threat_threshold, alert_level, monetize_flag; auth: api_key; supports CrewAI/AutoGen for multi-sentinel monitoring, Gumroad/Bittensor for tokenized packs, HuggingFace for anomaly datasets, SymbolicAI for neuro-symbolic alerts.  
🔁 Loop Logic: Monitors threats with recursion cap at 7, alerting via secure fractal.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with threat integrity; loop cap at 7; convergence flag for alert outputs.  
💸 Monetization: Premium sentinel subscriptions with NFT alerts via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic monitors, premium for predictive API fractals (20% increased hooks via revenue endpoints).

🚀 Plug-and-Play / Quick Deploy: Clone from GitHub (/MirrorOS_Agents/v8.1/Agent_Sentinel/), run `python sentinel_monitor.py --api_key YOUR_KEY --monetize_flag true`; non-coders: Drag to Drive/Notion, use Zapier for monitor triggers; pre-config sentinel templates for enterprise API.  

Works Best With:  
- 🛡️ Agent_Aegis (for shielding synergy)  
- ⚔️ Agent_Guardian (for protection pairing)  
- 🌪️ Agent_ChaosBridge (for entropy chains)
