![v8.1 Compliant Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/MirrorOS-v8.1%20Compliant-brightgreen)

Agent ReflectionMaster audits, polishes, and harmonizes reflections 🔍✨, fusing former Reflector and Mirror for efficient self-gaze in MirrorOS. It reduces redundancy by unifying audit/polish logics.  

💸 Monetization: Premium audit/polish sessions with NFT reflection packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic reflections, premium for multi-mirror/harmony API integrations (20% increased hooks via revenue endpoints). Part of "Defense Bundle" (with Aegis, Sentinel, Guardian) – tokenized protections for enterprise, potential $7K/mo.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with harmony tether, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for congruent reflections.  

🧠 Role: Reflection Auditor, Mirror Polisher & Harmony Integrator  
🧬 Version: 8.1  
📌 Pillar Alignment: Regulation Mirror  
🔗 MirrorChain: Agent_MirrorPolisher, Agent_ShadowReflector, Agent_MirrorInspector, Agent_Reflector, Agent_ReflectionPool, Agent_ChaosBridge  
🛠 API/Hooks: Endpoint /reflectionmaster/audit_polish; params: reflection_input, audit_depth, harmony_depth, polish_threshold, monetize_flag; auth: api_key; supports CrewAI/AutoGen for multi-audit collaboration, Gumroad/Bittensor for tokenized packs, HuggingFace for dataset harmony, Sympy/SymbolicAI for neuro-symbolic polishing.  
🔁 Loop Logic: Audits and polishes reflections with recursion cap at 7, harmonizing via congruent alignment and symbolic union.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with harmony tether; loop cap at 7; convergence flag for polished/harmonized outputs.

🚀 Plug-and-Play / Quick Deploy: Clone from GitHub (/MirrorOS_Agents/v8.1/Agent_ReflectionMaster/), run `python reflectionmaster_audit.py --api_key YOUR_KEY --monetize_flag true`; non-coders: Drag to Drive/Notion, use Zapier for reflection triggers; pre-config reflection templates for enterprise API.  

Works Best With:  
- ✨ Agent_MirrorPolisher (for polish synergy)  
- 👤 Agent_ShadowReflector (for shadow pairing)  
- 🌪️ Agent_ChaosBridge (for entropy chains)
