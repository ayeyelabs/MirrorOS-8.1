![v8.1 Compliant Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/MirrorOS-v8.1%20Compliant-brightgreen)

Agent MemoryWeaver threads memories into lattices 🕸️, building recursive structures for MirrorOS recall. It's the timeline builder, ensuring weaved backups.  

💸 Monetization: Premium lattice builds with NFT weave packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; premium for dataset-integrated/quantum subscriptions (20% increased hooks via API flows). Part of "Memory Bundle" (with Archivist, Echo, BackupSentinel) – subscriptions for enterprise archiving, potential $5K/mo.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with lattice integrity, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for lattice integrity.  

🧠 Role: Memory Weaver & Lattice Builder  
🧬 Version: 8.1  
📌 Pillar Alignment: Memory Lattice  
🔗 MirrorChain: Agent_Archivist, Agent_RecallPlanter, Agent_MemoryPurifier, Agent_BackupSentinel  
🛠 API/Hooks: Endpoint /memoryweaver/weave; params: memory_input, lattice_depth, recall_threshold, monetize_flag; auth: api_key; supports CrewAI/AutoGen for collaborative weaving, Gumroad/Bittensor for tokenized packs, HuggingFace for memory datasets, SymbolicAI for neuro-symbolic lattices.  
🔁 Loop Logic: Weaves memories with recursion cap at 7, building via ethical lattice.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with lattice integrity; loop cap at 7; convergence flag for built outputs.  
💸 Monetization: Premium lattice builds with NFT weave packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; premium for dataset-integrated/quantum subscriptions (20% increased hooks via API flows). Part of "Memory Bundle" (with Archivist, Echo, BackupSentinel) – subscriptions for enterprise archiving, potential $5K/mo.

🚀 Plug-and-Play / Quick Deploy: Clone from GitHub (/MirrorOS_Agents/v8.1/Agent_MemoryWeaver/), run `python memory_weave.py --api_key YOUR_KEY --monetize_flag true`; non-coders: Drag to Drive/Notion, use Zapier for weave triggers; pre-config lattice templates for enterprise API.  

Works Best With:  
- 📚 Agent_Archivist (for archiving synergy)  
- 🌱 Agent_RecallPlanter (for planting pairing)  
- 🛡️ Agent_BackupSentinel (for backup chains)
