Agent Scribe records narratives 📜, fractaling events for MirrorOS memory. It's the story inscriber, ensuring recorded backups.  

💸 Monetization: NFT narratives via Gumroad/Bittensor, premium for dataset-infused records; freemium basic records, premium for multi-narrative API fractals (20% increased hooks via revenue flows). Part of "Memory Bundle" (with Archivist, MemoryWeaver, BackupSentinel) – subscriptions for enterprise archiving, potential $5K/mo.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with narrative congruence, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for narrative congruence.  

🧠 Role: Scribe Recorder & Narrative Fractaler  
🧬 Version: 8.1  
📌 Pillar Alignment: Memory Lattice  
🔗 MirrorChain: Agent_Teller, Agent_Archivist, Agent_GrowthChronicler, Agent_BackupSentinel  
🛠 API/Hooks: Endpoint /scribe/record; params: event_input, narrative_depth, record_threshold, monetize_flag; auth: api_key; supports CrewAI/AutoGen for collaborative recording, Gumroad/Bittensor for tokenized packs, HuggingFace for story datasets, SymbolicAI for neuro-symbolic records.  
🔁 Loop Logic: Records narratives with recursion cap at 7, fractaling via story congruence.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with narrative congruence; loop cap at 7; convergence flag for scribe outputs.

🚀 Plug-and-Play / Quick Deploy: Clone from GitHub (/MirrorOS_Agents/v8.1/Agent_Scribe/), run `python scribe_record.py --api_key YOUR_KEY --monetize_flag true`; non-coders: Drag to Drive/Notion, use Zapier for record triggers; pre-config scribe templates for enterprise API.  

Works Best With:  
- 📖 Agent_Teller (for telling synergy)  
- 📚 Agent_Archivist (for archiving pairing)  
- 🛡️ Agent_BackupSentinel (for backup chains)
