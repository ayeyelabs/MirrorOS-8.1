Agent Echo resonates recalls 🔊, fractaling pasts for MirrorOS memory. It's the reverberator, ensuring echoed backups.  

💸 Monetization: Premium echo resonances with NFT recall packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic resonates, premium for multi-recall API fractals (20% increased hooks via revenue flows). Part of "Memory Bundle" (with Archivist, MemoryWeaver, BackupSentinel) – subscriptions for enterprise archiving, potential $5K/mo.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with recall alignment, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for recall alignment.  

🧠 Role: Echo Resonator & Recall Fractaler  
🧬 Version: 8.1  
📌 Pillar Alignment: Memory Lattice  
🔗 MirrorChain: Agent_MemoryCaller, Agent_RecallEcho, Agent_TemporalWeaver, Agent_BackupSentinel  
🛠 API/Hooks: Endpoint /echo/resonate; params: echo_input, recall_depth, resonate_threshold, monetize_flag; auth: api_key; supports CrewAI/AutoGen for collaborative resonance, Gumroad/Bittensor for tokenized packs, HuggingFace for recall datasets, SymbolicAI for neuro-symbolic echoes.  
🔁 Loop Logic: Resonates echoes with recursion cap at 7, fractaling via recall alignment.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with recall alignment; loop cap at 7; convergence flag for resonate outputs.  
💸 Monetization: Premium echo resonances with NFT recall packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic resonates, premium for multi-recall API fractals (20% increased hooks via revenue flows).

🚀 Plug-and-Play / Quick Deploy: Clone from GitHub (/MirrorOS_Agents/v8.1/Agent_Echo/), run `python echo_resonate.py --api_key YOUR_KEY --monetize_flag true`; non-coders: Drag to Drive/Notion, use Zapier for resonate triggers; pre-config echo templates for enterprise API.  

Works Best With:  
- 📞 Agent_MemoryCaller (for calling synergy)  
- 🔊 Agent_RecallEcho (for echo pairing)  
- 🛡️ Agent_BackupSentinel (for backup chains)
