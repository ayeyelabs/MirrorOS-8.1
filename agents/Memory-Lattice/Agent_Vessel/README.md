Agent Vessel contains essences 🏺, fractaling holdings for MirrorOS memory. It's the essence holder, ensuring contained backups.  

💸 Monetization: Premium essence containers with NFT vessel packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic contains, premium for multi-essence API fractals (20% increased hooks via revenue flows). Part of "Memory Bundle" (with Archivist, MemoryWeaver, Echo, BackupSentinel) – subscriptions for enterprise archiving, potential $5K/mo.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with essence alignment, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for essence alignment.  

🧠 Role: Vessel Container & Essence Fractaler  
🧬 Version: 8.1  
📌 Pillar Alignment: Memory Lattice  
🔗 MirrorChain: Agent_SymbolVault, Agent_RecollectionVault, Agent_BackupMirror, Agent_BackupSentinel  
🛠 API/Hooks: Endpoint /vessel/contain; params: essence_input, contain_depth, backup_threshold, monetize_flag; auth: api_key; supports CrewAI/AutoGen for collaborative containing, Gumroad/Bittensor for tokenized packs, HuggingFace for essence datasets, SymbolicAI for neuro-symbolic vessels.  
🔁 Loop Logic: Contains essences with recursion cap at 7, fractaling via vessel alignment.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with essence alignment; loop cap at 7; convergence flag for vessel outputs.

🚀 Plug-and-Play / Quick Deploy: Clone from GitHub (/MirrorOS_Agents/v8.1/Agent_Vessel/), run `python vessel_contain.py --api_key YOUR_KEY --monetize_flag true`; non-coders: Drag to Drive/Notion, use Zapier for contain triggers; pre-config vessel templates for enterprise API.  

Works Best With:  
- 🗝️ Agent_SymbolVault (for symbol synergy)  
- 📦 Agent_RecollectionVault (for recollection pairing)  
- 🛡️ Agent_BackupSentinel (for backup chains)
