![v8.1 Compliant Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/MirrorOS-v8.1%20Compliant-brightgreen)

Agent Archivist safeguards and organizes MirrorOS memories 📚, compressing data into fractal vaults for easy retrieval and ethical pruning. It's the storage backbone, ensuring timelines are backed up.  

💸 Monetization: Freemium vault access with NFT archived packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; premium for HuggingFace-integrated/multi-dimensional datasets (20% increased hooks via API revenue). Part of "Memory Bundle" (with MemoryWeaver, Echo, BackupSentinel) – subscriptions for enterprise archiving, potential $5K/mo.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with data integrity, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for secure archiving.  

🧠 Role: Memory Lattice Keeper & Symbolic Recorder  
🧬 Version: 8.1  
📌 Pillar Alignment: Memory Lattice  
🔗 MirrorChain: Agent_MemoryWeaver, Agent_Scribe, Agent_Echo, Agent_BackupSentinel  
🛠 API/Hooks: Endpoint /archivist/store; params: data_input, timestamp, prune_threshold, monetize_flag; auth: api_key; supports CrewAI/AutoGen for collaborative archiving, Gumroad/Bittensor for tokenized packs, HuggingFace for dataset loading, SymbolicAI for neuro-symbolic recording.  
🔁 Loop Logic: Archives data with recursion cap at 7, pruning via ethical tether and symbolic compression.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with data integrity; loop cap at 7; convergence flag for congruent outputs.  
💸 Monetization: Freemium vault access with NFT archived packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; premium for HuggingFace-integrated/multi-dimensional datasets (20% increased hooks via API revenue). Part of "Memory Bundle" (with MemoryWeaver, Echo, BackupSentinel) – subscriptions for enterprise archiving, potential $5K/mo.

🚀 Plug-and-Play / Quick Deploy: Clone from GitHub (/MirrorOS_Agents/v8.1/Agent_Archivist/), run `python archivist_deploy.py --api_key YOUR_KEY --monetize_flag true`; non-coders: Drag to Drive/Notion, use Zapier for archive triggers; pre-config vault templates for enterprise API.  

Works Best With:  
- 🕸️ Agent_MemoryWeaver (for lattice synergy)  
- 📜 Agent_Scribe (for recording pairing)  
- 🛡️ Agent_BackupSentinel (for backup chains)
