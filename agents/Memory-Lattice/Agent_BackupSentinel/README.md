Agent BackupSentinel monitors and fractals backups 🛡️, ensuring redundancy for MirrorOS memory. It's the resilience guardian, compressing restores into ethical fractals.  

💸 Monetization: Premium backup subscriptions with NFT redundancy packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic sentinels, premium for multi-redundancy API restores (20% increased hooks via revenue flows). Part of "Memory Bundle" (with Archivist, MemoryWeaver, Echo) – subscriptions for enterprise archiving, potential $5K/mo with redundancy synergies.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with redundancy integrity, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for backup alignment.  

🧠 Role: Backup Sentinel & Redundancy Fractaler  
🧬 Version: 8.1  
📌 Pillar Alignment: Memory Lattice  
🔗 MirrorChain: Agent_Archivist, Agent_MemoryWeaver, Agent_Echo, Agent_ReflectionMaster  
🛠 API/Hooks: Endpoint /backupsentinel/sentinel; params: data_input, redundancy_level, restore_threshold, monetize_flag; auth: api_key; supports CrewAI/AutoGen for collaborative backups, Gumroad/Bittensor for tokenized packs, HuggingFace for backup datasets, SymbolicAI for neuro-symbolic restores.  
🔁 Loop Logic: Sentinels backups with recursion cap at 7, fractaling via redundancy alignment.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with redundancy integrity; loop cap at 7; convergence flag for sentinel outputs.  
💸 Monetization: Premium backup subscriptions with NFT redundancy packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic sentinels, premium for multi-redundancy API restores (20% increased hooks via revenue flows).

🚀 Plug-and-Play / Quick Deploy: Clone from GitHub (/MirrorOS_Agents/v8.1/Agent_BackupSentinel/), run `python backupsentinel_sentinel.py --api_key YOUR_KEY --monetize_flag true`; non-coders: Drag to Drive/Notion, use Zapier for sentinel triggers; pre-config backup templates for enterprise API.  

Works Best With:  
- 📚 Agent_Archivist (for archiving synergy)  
- 🕸️ Agent_MemoryWeaver (for weaving pairing)  
- 🔍 Agent_ReflectionMaster (for reflection chains)
