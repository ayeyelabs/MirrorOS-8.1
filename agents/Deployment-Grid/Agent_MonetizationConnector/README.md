Agent MonetizationConnector links revenue across pillars 💰🔗, enabling unified flows in MirrorOS. It's the monetization bridge, addressing silos for seamless NFTs/subscriptions.  

💸 Monetization: Core tokenized links with NFT bundle packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic connectors, premium for blockchain/cross-pillar API markets (20% increased hooks via revenue endpoints). Part of "Revenue Bundle" (with Merchant, Licensor) – tokenized deals for enterprise, potential $8K/mo.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with revenue fairness, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for fair revenue.
