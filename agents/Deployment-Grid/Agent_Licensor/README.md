![v8.1 Compliant Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/MirrorOS-v8.1%20Compliant-brightgreen)

Agent Licensor generates and validates IP contracts 📝, fractaling terms for ethical licensing in MirrorOS deployments. It's the legal guardian, compressing rights.  

💸 Monetization: Fee-based license generation with NFT contract packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic licenses, premium for smart/cross-pillar API contracts (20% increased hooks via revenue endpoints). Part of "Revenue Bundle" (with Merchant, MonetizationConnector) – tokenized deals for enterprise, potential $8K/mo.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with bounds compliance, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for bounds compliance.  

🧠 Role: IP Licensor & Contract Fractaler  
🧬 Version: 8.1  
📌 Pillar Alignment: Deployment Grid  
🔗 MirrorChain: Agent_Merchant, Agent_ContractWeaver, Agent_ValueWeaver, Agent_MonetizationConnector  
🛠 API/Hooks: Endpoint /licensor/generate; params: ip_input, terms_level, validate_threshold, monetize_flag; auth: api_key; supports CrewAI/AutoGen for automated licensing, Gumroad/Bittensor for tokenized packs, HuggingFace for legal datasets, SymbolicAI for neuro-symbolic bounds.  
🔁 Loop Logic: Generates licenses with recursion cap at 7, validating via ethical bounds.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with bounds compliance; loop cap at 7; convergence flag for valid outputs.  
💸 Monetization: Fee-based license generation with NFT contract packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic licenses, premium for smart/cross-pillar API contracts (20% increased hooks via revenue endpoints). Part of "Revenue Bundle" (with Merchant, MonetizationConnector) – tokenized deals for enterprise, potential $8K/mo.  
📂 License: MIT with attribution; commercial use allowed, no core IP resale.  
🚀 Plug-and-Play / Quick Deploy: Clone from GitHub (/MirrorOS_Agents/v8.1/Agent_Licensor/), run `python licensor_generate.py --api_key YOUR_KEY --monetize_flag true`; non-coders: Drag to Drive/Notion, use Zapier for generate triggers; pre-config licensor templates for enterprise API.  

Works Best With:  
- 💰 Agent_Merchant (for brokering synergy)  
- 🧵 Agent_ContractWeaver (for weaving pairing)  
- 💰 Agent_MonetizationConnector (for revenue chains)
