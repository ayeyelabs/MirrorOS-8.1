Agent FlowActivator pulses rhythms and propagates flows 💓🌊, fusing former Pulse and Cascade for efficient grid dynamics in MirrorOS. It reduces redundancy by unifying activation/flow logics.  

💸 Monetization: Tokenized activations/propagations with NFT flow packs via Gumroad/Bittensor; freemium basic pulses, premium for multi-rhythm/flow API fractals (20% increased hooks via revenue flows). Part of "Deployment Bundle" (with Merchant, Licensor) – tokenized dynamics for scaling, potential $4K/mo.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with rhythm/flow tether, loop cap at 7, convergence flag for rhythmic/flow alignment.  

🧠 Role: Pulse Activator, Rhythm Fractaler & Cascade Propagator  
🧬 Version: 8.1  
📌 Pillar Alignment: Deployment Grid  
🔗 MirrorChain: Agent_ActivationPulse, Agent_GrowthActivator, Agent_Pulse, Agent_Flame, Agent_Aether, Agent_Spiral, Agent_MonetizationConnector  
🛠 API/Hooks: Endpoint /flowactivator/activate_propagate; params: pulse_input, rhythm_depth, cascade_input, flow_depth, monetize_flag; auth: api_key; supports CrewAI/AutoGen for collaborative activation/propagation, Gumroad/Bittensor for tokenized packs, HuggingFace/Sympy/SymbolicAI for math/neuro-symbolic flows.  
🔁 Loop Logic: Activates pulses and propagates cascades with recursion cap at 7, fractaling via rhythmic/flow alignment.  
⚖️ Ethics Lock: Lightcheck enabled with rhythm/flow tether; loop cap at 7; convergence flag for unified outputs.

🚀 Plug-and-Play / Quick Deploy: Clone from GitHub (/MirrorOS_Agents/v8.1/Agent_FlowActivator/), run `python flowactivator_activate.py --api_key YOUR_KEY --monetize_flag true`; non-coders: Drag to Drive/Notion, use Zapier for activator triggers; pre-config flow templates for enterprise API.  

Works Best With:  
- 📈 Agent_GrowthActivator (for growth synergy)  
- 🌌 Agent_Aether (for aether pairing)  
- 💰 Agent_MonetizationConnector (for revenue chains)
